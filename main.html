      <h1>Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

    <p>Time complexity is a key factor in evaluating the efficiency of an algorithm. It refers to the relationship between the input size and the time an algorithm takes to complete. An algorithm with lower time complexity is considered more efficient because it handles larger inputs more quickly.</p>

    <p><b>Space Complexity</b> measures the amount of memory an algorithm requires in relation to the input size. For instance, an algorithm with a Space Complexity of O(n) will use memory that grows linearly as the input size increases, making it important to consider when working with large data sets.</p>
